# Freelancer-Trade-Route
Calculates based on the ingame data files the proift for different trade routes. Should work for most mods, works for Crossfire (just run it after the daily update to get current routes)
#Why? Over this years holidays I started to play the game again, and quickly found it annoying to always start searching for routes again.

If someone wants to maintain this feel free to fork or make pull requests.

#NOTE: I do not care about issues, either fix it yourself (and send me a patch) or use something else.

#How to use
java -jar tool.jar 1500 c:/freelancer/

#The extracted symbols in the files folder are matching for Crossfire 2.0, please note that it might be required to extract them for other / newer mods
